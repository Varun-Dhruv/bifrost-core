# Contributing Guidelines

This markdown file outlines the guidelines for contributing to the Bifrost project.

## Pre-commit hooks

To ensure code quality and consistency, we recommend installing pre-commit hooks. These hooks will run before each commit and can be used to enforce code formatting, linting, and other checks.

## Commit message conventions

When making a commit, please prepend the commit message with a label indicating the type of work being done. For example, if the changes are related to the backend, prepend the message with `backend:`, or if the changes are related to CI/CD, prepend the message with `CI:`. This will help us better understand the nature of the changes being made.

## Makefile commands

We utilize Makefile commands to automate certain tasks and streamline the development process. Please refer to the Makefile for a list of available commands.

## Branching and Pull Requests

When working on a new feature or bug fix, please create a new branch with a descriptive name. Once the work is complete, create a pull request to merge the changes into the `master` branch.

Thank you for contributing to the Bifrost project!
